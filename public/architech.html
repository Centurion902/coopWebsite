						<div class="wideCardGoal">
							<h5 class="brightText">Goal 1: Technological Literacy</h5>
							<p class="brightText tab">
								My goal was to become proficient with deployment and development tools such as google firebase, git, node and Azure.
							</p>

							<h5 class="brightText">Action Plan:</h5>
							<p class="brightText tab">
								To achieve this goal, I planned to learn the mentioned tools through immersion by using them to complete my assigned tasks.
							</p>

							<h5 class="brightText">Measure of Success</h5>
							<p class="brightText tab">
								The definition of success would be to be able to deliver quality code with minimal bugs while using these tools. Specifically, I should have been able to manage git branches, set up firebase projects, create Azure cloud functions and use node without asking for assistance by November 30th.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="wideCardReflection">
							<h5>Reflection:</h5>
							<p class="tab">
								My goal to become proficient with development tools such as firebase, git, and node has been largely achieved.
							</p>
							<p class="tab">
								By November 30th, I was able to manage the project both with git command-line and Gui version control tools such as Sourcetree and Gitkraken. I also knew how to set up and run various types of projects using firebase. Now, at the end of December, I have learned to use Nodejs and completed a proof of concept using it.
							</p>
							<p class="tab">
								As stated in my measure of success, I was indeed able to deliver code with few bugs. At the alpha testing, the project I was working on only had a single, easily fixable bug that did not significantly affect operation.
							</p>
							<p class="tab">
								Despite this success, I did not get the chance to practice working with Azure due to the way the tasks had to be split up for efficiency.
							</p>
							<p>
								In all, I am satisfied with my achievements for this goal.
							</p>
						</div>

				<div class="scrolling-wrapper">
					<div class="wideCard">
						<div class="wideCardGoal">
							<h5 class="brightText">Goal 2: Problem Solving</h5>
							<p class="brightText tab">
								The goal was to improve my problem solving, algorithm design and bug fixing skills,
							</p>

							<h5 class="brightText">Action Plan:</h5>
							<p class="brightText tab">
								I planned to begin with non-complex stories, building up my problem-solving skills slowly. Each sprint, I would endeavor to be assigned an available story more complex than the one before.
							</p>

							<h5 class="brightText">Measure of Success</h5>
							<p class="brightText tab">
								Success would mean being able to complete complex stories or solve elusive bugs in time for demo's. This was set to be done by  December 10th.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="wideCardReflection">
							<h5>Reflection:</h5>
							<p class="tab">
								I had stuck closely to my action plan by beginning with simple stories and increasing complexity over time. This progressed quickly and as of December 10th, I have solved complex and unintuitive problems such as setting up input validation that allowed retries for a voice user interface in a framework that had no native support for such things.
							</p>
							<p class="tab">
								I had managed to understand and work around the core limitations of the software we were using in order to implement the design given to me.
							</p>
							<p class="tab">
								By January 10th, I had also completed a system that let users retry questions quickly with small variations without having to give all other information again.
							</p>
							<p class="tab">
								Finally, I created a proof of concept for a vote display where I did not just implement what was asked but also improved on the original design to provide cost savings and a smoother, more reactive visualization.		
							</p>
							<p class="tab">
								All of these solutions were achieved under time constraints that led up to demo's where I would have to showcase the working product.

					<div class="wideCard">
						<div class="wideCardGoal">
							<h5 class="brightText">Goal 3: Oral Communication</h5>
							<p class="brightText tab">
								This goal was to be able to improve my communication skills to minimize confusion between co-workers and myself and reduce mistakes or unnecessary work.
							</p>

							<h5 class="brightText">Action Plan:</h5>
							<p class="brightText tab">
								I planned to achieve this goal by creating a rough design for each task before beginning it. I would then present it to a senior developer in order to ensure it matched up with the requirements and projected development path. Misunderstandings would hopefully be caught at this step.
							</p>

							<h5 class="brightText">Measure of Success</h5>
							<p class="brightText tab">
								Success would be measured by the number of tasks completed without significant misunderstandings requiring a redo of work. I would strive for this number to be at 1 or less per two sprints (4 weeks) by November 30th.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="wideCardReflection">
							<h5>Reflection:</h5>
							<p class="tab">
								The goal of achieving 1 or fewer misunderstandings requiring a redo of work per sprint had been achieved by November 1st.

									
							</p>
							<p class="tab">
								Since then, I have worked on ensuring the number is 0 for all subsequent sprints. I have been successful in this endeavor with no redo's being required as of January 10th.
									
									
							</p>
							<p class="tab">
								In addition to this, I have learned how to better explain myself to different types of co-workers and improved my knowledge of when to explain and when to save the details for a different meeting.
									
									
							</p>
							<p class="tab">
								This was possible precisely due to my action plan where I made frequent contact with designers and senior developers and explained my plan to achieve their design to them in order to catch misunderstandings early.
									
									
							</p>
							<p>
								I can say with certainty that this goal and the larger overarching goal of improving my communication skills, has been achieved.

				<h1 class="brightText">Job Description</h1>
				<div class="sectionTextDiv module">
					<p class="tab brightText sectionText">
						My responsibilities as a software engineer at Architech included implementing conversation flows in a voice user interface (Google Home), creating cloud functions, prototyping data visualizations, and documenting my work. For each of these varied tasks I had to adapt and learn quickly as I had never worked with Google Home, or cloud services before. The technical skills for each job had to be picked on the job through research, experimentation and discussion with co-workers more knowledgeable of the technology. These included working with Dialogflow, Firebase, GCP and node. For the data visualization task though, my skills with javascript and css, as well as general programing principles learned during university projects are what helped me succeed.
					</p>
					<p class="tab brightText sectionText">
						Working with Dialogflow was definitely the most interesting part of my job simply because it required a different style of programing that was more state based than sequential. This made me completely rethink how I would have to structure my code in order to make the Google Home act as expected. Much of my work done at Architech was done with Googles cloud infrastructure, including writing cloud functions and using FireStore for scalable storage.
					</p>
					<p class="tab brightText sectionText">
						Documentation was a significant part of my job as well. To keep my projects maintainable, after I had completed a project I would document my findings and detail running and startup procedures so that others could work on the project after I had moved on. 
					</p>
					<p class="tab brightText sectionText">
						Collaborating with others was also a key part of the job. Soft, interpersonal skills were key here that helped me effectively communicate with project managers, designers and other engineers in order to solve problems and clear up misunderstandings. These were especially useful at our end of sprint ceremonies where we would go over what went well and what could be improved on, as well as plan for the next sprint.

				<h1 class="brightText">Cloud Computing and AutoML</h1>
				<div class="sectionTextDiv module textDivFocus">
					<p class="tab sectionText">
						For me, the focus of any working engagement is most often the technology I am working with. Working with Google cloud has put me in touch with the wide variety of machine learning based tools google has.
					</p>

					<p class="tab sectionText">
						Dialogflow is the perfect jumping off point to talk about AutoML. Voice and phrase recognition is vital to the use of voice user interfaces (VUI's) and any developer of a VUI needs a machine learning tool that will do the hard work of learning the trigger phrases. Most developers are not machine learning engineers and this is where AutoML becomes the most useful. By setting up the  pipeline for training, correcting and deploying the voice recognizing model, developers can now just give target phrases, let the pipeline train the model on google's hardware, and focus on developing their own applications. Developers that are unhappy with the achieved accuracy can add their own corrections to the training phrases and have models retrained in real time.
					</p>

					<p class="tab sectionText">
						To pair with Dialogflow, I was working with Firebase which Google provides as a cloud service to host functions, databases websites and more. Its scalable serverless model was perfect for allowing us to prototype and develop quickly. When the service we were building was complete it would have no problem scaling up to match the number of users since the functions could have their instances multiplied.
					</p>

					<p class="sectionText">
						I greatly enjoyed digging into this set of technologies and hope to work with similar ones soon.

				<div class="sectionTextDiv module textDivRelax">
					<p class="tab sectionText brightText">
						My time at Architech has been a fantastic learning experience. The tasks given pushed me to change the way I thought about programing and problem solving, and caused a fundamental shift in how I view software development by having me use tools I had no experience with up until this point. The fast pace environment where you had to always learn to keep up meshed well with the coworkers that were always happy to provide support and answer questions. The experience feels as though it has prepared me for future co-ops and tougher tasks.
