						<div class="wideCardGoal">
							<h5 class="brightText">Goal 2: Written Communication</h5>
							<p class="brightText tab">
								My goal was to write up a literature review in an organized and understandable way that syntheses the main ideas and highlights the connections across the Machine Vision papers, as well as identifies the gaps in the research.
							</p>

							<h5 class="brightText">Action Plan:</h5>
							<p class="brightText tab">
								The plan was to take careful notes during my readings that would reference papers I had previously read. When writing, I planned to write my document iteratively, with each pass refining the details of my review and incorporating feedback from frequent consultations with my supervisor.
							</p>

							<h5 class="brightText">Measure of Success:</h5>
							<p class="brightText tab">
								Success would be having the final review be considered acceptable by my supervisor.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="wideCardReflection">
							<h5>Reflection:</h5>
							<p class="tab">
								I have achieved the goal of delivering an organized and understandable systemic literature review that highlights the common trends throughout the research and discusses the challenges and future directions for it.
							</p>
							<p class="tab">
								My review was developed precisely according to my action plan starting with detailed notes on each paper, followed by partial summaries of groups of papers. The summaries were then used as a base for drafts that iterated on each other with frequent feedback from my supervisor.
							</p>
							<p class="tab">
								The final product neatly summarized the core details of the reviewed papers and was approved by my supervisor.

							<h5 class="brightText">Goal 3: Inquiry & Analysis</h5>
							<p class="brightText tab">
								This goal was to complete a systematic literature review that involves the collection and analysis of relevant scientific papers.
							</p>

							<h5 class="brightText">Action Plan:</h5>
							<p class="brightText tab">
								My plan is to follow the systematic literature review process outlined by Dr. Andy Siddaway in his paper "What is a systematic literature review and how do I do one?" published <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2214/2c9cb17b4baab118767e497c93806d741461.pdf">here</a>.
							</p>

							<h5 class="brightText">Measure of Success:</h5>

								My success would be measured by wether or not the papers resulting from the literature review process met the criteria set by my coop supervisor for relevance.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="wideCardReflection">
							<h5>Reflection:</h5>
							<p class="tab">
								As evidenced by the completion of the systematic literature review paper, I was able to complete this goal.
							</p>
							<p class="tab">
								The process of conducting the review was done in accordance with the paper outlined in the action plan and involved crafting a set of search terms, inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria.
							</p>
							<p class="tab">
								These were developed iteratively to ensure that relevant papers were being captured. The resulting papers were deemed relevant by my supervisor and the process of reading them unearthed further relevant papers that also were included in the review.

					<p class="tab brightText sectionText">
						As an undergraduate researcher working under Stacey D. Scott at the School of Computer Science, my responsibilities were based around the research of Machine Vision technologies as they were applied to livestock monitoring.
					</p>
					<p class="tab brightText sectionText">
						I was responsible for finding and filtering for relevant papers through the use of databases such as the Web of Science and EBSCO Host, managing my citations with Mendeley and summarizing the core ideas of the papers I had read for my supervisor in the form of Powerpoint presentations. The ultimate responsibility of the work term was the delivery of a systematic literature review.
					</p>
					<p class="tab brightText sectionText">
						The documentation of my work was a significant part of my job and it included maintaining a database of citations as well as careful note taking while I was reading papers so as to make the process of synthesizing my analysis of over 35 papers manageable. In addition, such documentation would allow others to contribute to the report once my work term had ended.
					</p>
					<p class="tab brightText sectionText">
						As this work term was completed remotely, one of my most important responsibilities was maintaining clear communication with my supervisors to minimize misunderstandings and ensure work advanced at a steady pace.

					<p class="tab sectionText">
						This work term had me delve deep into how Machine Vision was applied to the counting and health monitoring of livestock, as well as the nuances of data fusion. In my research, I worked through the advancements made in the field in the past 10 years and saw the move from expert systems relying on hand crafted rules to count animals in infrared data to a reliance on machine learning techniques that use various neural network architectures in order to separate animals from the background and each other.
					</p>

					<p class="tab sectionText">
						I learned about techniques such as Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) which could take advantage of multiple image and information sources to apply hand written rules for the segmentation and labeling of images. I also learned about the different ways in which Convolutional Neural networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) were used in the field to detect and label animals. In combination with each other, these two architectures can be combined into an R-CNN which was in several papers used to analyze video and in several was able to be used to identify individual cattle in a herd by their black and white markings. 
					</p>

					<p class="tab sectionText">
						Through my research, I learned about the concept of data fusion in which multiple sources and potentially types of data are combined so as to create more consistent, accurate and useful information. One example as mentioned previously was with OBIA which could take in multiple data sources and in one paper was able to combine infrared and RGB data in order to perfectly count deer. 
					</p>

					<p class="sectionText">
						As a student deeply interested in machine learning technologies, I greatly enjoyed the research I was able to do here and feel that I have improved my understanding of the technologies used in the papers I have reviewed.

					<p class="tab sectionText brightText">
						My time working as an undergraduate research assistant under Stacey D. Scott has been a wonderful learning experience. The work done has introduced me to the work done in academia and I feel that both my skill and mindset are now more well rounded thanks to having worked here. Throughout my work I was always pushed to learn more about the technology that made the achievements of each paper possible and to understand how it could be applied in other fields. The remote nature of my work has also taught me how to work remotely with others and manage my own time with real deliverables on the line. More than anything, I am proud of the work I have a achieved in this short time and I look forward to my chance to once again apply what I have learned.
